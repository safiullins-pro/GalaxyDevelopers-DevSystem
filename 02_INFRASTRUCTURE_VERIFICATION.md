# Infrastructure Verification Results

**Audit Date:** August 18, 2025  
**Auditor:** Independent Technical Audit Team  
**Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURES

## Database Migration: ‚ùå FAIL
- PostgreSQL connected: ‚ùå CONNECTION FAILED
- Data migrated from SQLite: ‚ö†Ô∏è CANNOT VERIFY (DB DOWN)
- Required indexes created: ‚ö†Ô∏è CANNOT VERIFY (DB DOWN)
- Performance improved: ‚ö†Ô∏è CANNOT VERIFY (DB DOWN)

**Critical Issue:** PostgreSQL database is not accessible at postgresql://localhost:5432/galaxydb

## Redis Session Storage: ‚úÖ PASS  
- Redis server running: ‚úÖ RESPONDS TO PING
- Session storage functional: ‚ö†Ô∏è CANNOT VERIFY (APP TESTS NEEDED)
- Session persistence works: ‚ö†Ô∏è CANNOT VERIFY (APP TESTS NEEDED)

**Status:** Redis infrastructure is operational but application integration untested

## CI/CD Pipeline: ‚ùå FAIL
- Pipeline configuration exists: ‚ùå NO .github/workflows/ OR .gitlab-ci.yml
- Recent builds successful: ‚ùå NO AUTOMATED BUILDS CONFIGURED
- Automated deployment works: ‚ùå NO DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION

**Critical Issue:** No CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing and deployment

## Application Server: üü° PARTIAL
- Node.js server running: ‚úÖ BACKEND PROCESS DETECTED (PID: 41975)
- Health endpoint accessible: ‚ùå REDIRECTS TO LOGIN (NOT PROPER HEALTH CHECK)
- Server responding: üü° REDIRECTS INSTEAD OF PROPER RESPONSES

**Critical Issue:** Health endpoint not properly configured - returns login redirect instead of health status

## Infrastructure Test Results:
```bash
‚ùå PostgreSQL: Connection refused
‚úÖ Redis: PONG response successful  
‚ùå CI/CD: No configuration files found
üü° Application: Running but health check misconfigured
```

## OVERALL INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS: ‚ùå FAIL

**BLOCKING ISSUES:**
1. PostgreSQL database not running or misconfigured
2. No CI/CD pipeline for automated testing/deployment
3. Health monitoring endpoints not properly configured
4. Database migration status unknown due to DB unavailability

**REQUIREMENTS NOT MET:**
- Database infrastructure must be accessible and operational
- CI/CD pipeline required for HORIZON 1 completion
- Proper health checks required for monitoring
- Database migration from SQLite must be verified

**RECOMMENDATION:**
üî¥ **INFRASTRUCTURE NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION** - Critical database and CI/CD infrastructure missing. Cannot proceed with performance testing until these foundational issues are resolved.
